# Design QA

- References: `C:/Users/tavri/Downloads/IMG_3460.PNG`, `IMG_3461.PNG`, `IMG_3462.PNG`, and `IMG_3463.PNG`.
- Target: correct mobile sheet padding, natural-height action menu, keyboard-stable route-based creation flows, clearly layered system-settings navigation and category editing, independently presented desktop settings/notification popups with generous padding, slightly heavier dialog top padding, centered sidebar avatar, and retained neumorphic shadows without iOS WebKit ghost layers.
- Structural review: sheet handle removed from layout flow; padded dialogs add a small top optical adjustment; action menu uses content height; proposal/facility/announcement creation share dedicated `/new` route pages tied to Visual Viewport height and unsaved-navigation guards; system settings and Setup use the same equal-width feature segments and selected-category editor, keep feature switches in the batch-save draft, disable category fields while the draft feature is off, keep only the unique-default switch, and treat deletion as permanent removal of all related records; Setup explicitly confirms that manager assignment is deferred until people register; mobile category selection scrolls horizontally; desktop utility panels no longer share visible navigation and use one 40–48px padding token; skeleton opacity runs on a shadow-free inner node; keyed list teardown no longer recreates the shadow tree; iOS route transitions avoid transformed shadow ancestors.
- Automated review: `verify:local` passed; the separately rerun `verify:integration` passed 18 tests with 0 failures.
- Visual comparison: blocked because this repository's `AGENTS.md` explicitly prohibits in-app browser preview. No browser screenshot was captured.

final result: blocked
