# Local integration verifier

The suite rebuilds an isolated local Supabase stack and never writes to the
configured remote project.

## Commands

| Change | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend / ordinary refactor | `npm run verify:local` |
| Migration, RPC, RLS, permission, Edge action or worker | `npm run verify:integration` |
| Large change / before merge | `npm run verify:all` |

PR CI runs both suites.

## Environment

On Windows, run the npm command normally; it enters WSL automatically. WSL 2,
Docker, Supabase CLI and Deno must be available. To use a distro other than
Debian:

```powershell
$env:NOVAE_WSL_DISTRO = 'Ubuntu'
```

`.env.local` is optional and gitignored. The suite uses fixed safe local values
and never injects deployment/provider credentials into Edge tests. Use
`--keep-running` to retain containers after a run.

GitHub Actions installs the current official Deno runtime explicitly instead of
using the compatibility runtime bundled for Windows Edge type checks.

New actions must include asserted positive and denial cases. The coverage guard
fails when a registered action is not referenced. Full maintenance rules:
[official contributing guide](https://tavricccc.github.io/novae-website/docs/contributing.html).

The verifier also starts isolated Upstash and external-provider receivers. Notification tests
assert in-app recipients, FCM topic/token payloads, preference filtering, and
deep links without contacting production providers. Retention tests seed both
sides of every configured expiry boundary and assert deletion, preservation,
Cloudinary deletion execution, worker chaining, and silent scheduled cleanup.
