# Configuration reference

[繁體中文](../configuration.md) · [Documentation home](../README.md)

Configuration has three boundaries: versioned product rules, public values bundled for browsers, and private backend/deployment secrets. Never move a value across these boundaries without reviewing its exposure.

## Generated configuration

| Source | Controls |
| --- | --- |
| `config/issue-categories.config.json` | Categories, visibility, author display, support, and response deadlines |
| `config/rate-limits.config.json` | Action limits, image counts, and compression |

After editing either file:

```bash
npm run generate:all
git diff
```

Generated output is committed with its source. Typecheck, lint, and build also run generation first.

## Category schema

```json
{
  "id": "public-issues",
  "label": "公共議題",
  "readAccess": "reviewed-school",
  "authorVisible": false,
  "support": { "enabled": true, "goal": 50, "deadlineDays": 14 },
  "responseDeadlineDays": 7
}
```

`id` is a permanent unique identifier and must not be renamed or reused after launch. `label` is user-facing. `readAccess` accepts `school`, `reviewed-school`, or `owner-admin`. `authorVisible` controls display, not whether the backend retains author identity. Enabled support requires a positive `goal` and `deadlineDays`; `responseDeadlineDays` controls the management response target.

| Access value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `school` | Any signed-in user in the allowed domain can read |
| `reviewed-school` | Author/admin before approval; school-wide after approval |
| `owner-admin` | Only the author and administrators can read |

Before removing a used category, inventory existing content, copies, search, and statistics. Add a forward migration to clean up or migrate data; never edit an already-deployed migration.

### Common combinations

| Combination | Typical content | User-visible result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `school`, visible author, no support | Facility report | School users can read it and see the author; no support progress |
| `reviewed-school`, hidden author, support | Public issue | Admin review first; approval exposes anonymous content and a support deadline |
| `owner-admin`, visible author, no support | Rights case | Only author/admin can read; identity supports case follow-up |

Changing `authorVisible` cannot undo identity already seen or captured. A higher `goal` or shorter `deadlineDays` makes success harder. Test and communicate how changes apply to existing proposals; do not assume configuration changes are automatically retroactive.

## Rate limits and images

Each action limit has a numeric `limit` and a user-facing message. Per-second limits absorb bursts; hourly/daily limits manage abuse and cost. Check Edge, Redis, database, and vendor capacity before raising them.

`imageUploads` limits attachments by content type. `imageCompression` sets source size, pixel count, longest edge, target KB, WebP quality, and fallback scales. Browser checks improve UX; the backend still validates upload ownership, state, and Markdown references.

### Rate-limit behavior

| Key group | User or system effect when exceeded |
| --- | --- |
| `issueCreateDaily` | No more proposals that day |
| `commentCreateHourly` | Comments and replies pause temporarily |
| `imageUploadDaily` | No new image upload sessions that day |
| `loginSyncHourly`, `avatarCacheDaily` | Repeated profile synchronization/update pauses |
| `supportToggleHourly`, `announcementLikeHourly` | Support or like toggles pause temporarily |
| `pushTokenWriteHourly` | Device Push registration pauses; in-app notifications continue |
| `backendActionRead*` | General reads receive hourly and burst protection |
| `backendActionWrite*` | General writes receive hourly and burst protection |
| `backendActionSensitiveWrite*` | Deletion and sensitive writes use stricter limits |
| `backendActionAdminWrite*` | Administrator writes have an independent limit |
| `backendActionUploadResolve*` | Signed image resolution pauses and images may fail to load |
| `backendHealthcheck*` | Excess health probes are rejected |
| `cloudinaryWebhook*` | Excess image callbacks are rejected or delayed |
| `workerRun*` | Duplicate worker triggers are rejected |

Lower limits reduce abuse and cost but reject legitimate peaks more often. Messages should explain when to retry without disclosing internal defenses.

### Image behavior

`issueMaxImages`, `announcementMaxImages`, and `commentMaxImages` cap references per item. `maxSourceMegabytes` rejects oversized source files before expensive work. `maxDimension` limits the longest output edge. `maxUploadKilobytes` is the compression target, `webpQuality` is the first-pass quality, and `outputScales` are progressively smaller retries. Smaller values save bandwidth but can reduce readability and increase compression failures.

## Frontend environment variables

Every value below is visible to browser users. Put local-development values in the untracked `.env`; for deployment, use GitHub `production` / `development` **Environment secrets**, not Environment variables. See the [from-scratch deployment guide](deployment-guide.md) for exact acquisition steps.

| Name | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `VITE_SCHOOL_NAME` | No | School name shown on startup and account screens; hidden when empty |
| `VITE_ALLOWED_DOMAIN` | Yes | Sign-in hint and client precheck |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY` | Yes | Firebase Web configuration |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN` | Yes | Firebase Auth domain |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` | Yes | Firebase project ID |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID` | Yes | Firebase Web App ID |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID` | Yes | FCM sender ID |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_VAPID_KEY` | Yes | Web Push public key |
| `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_CHECK_ENABLED` | No | Enables App Check when `true` |
| `VITE_RECAPTCHA_ENTERPRISE_SITE_KEY` | Conditional | Required with App Check |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | Yes | Supabase project URL |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Yes | Supabase publishable key |

## Backend and deployment secrets

| Group | Names |
| --- | --- |
| Supabase | `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF`, `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` |
| Firebase | `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`, `FIREBASE_WEB_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` |
| Access | `ALLOWED_DOMAIN`, `ADMIN_EMAILS` |
| Cloudinary | `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`, `CLOUDINARY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` |
| Internal | `WEBHOOK_SECRET` |
| Notion | `NOTION_TOKEN`, `NOTION_DATABASE_ID`, optional `NOTION_VERSION` |
| Upstash | `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` |
| Vercel | `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` |

`ADMIN_EMAILS` is required and contains full addresses separated by ASCII commas, such as `admin@school.edu.tw,backup@school.edu.tw`. Keep `VITE_ALLOWED_DOMAIN` and `ALLOWED_DOMAIN` identical and enter only the text after `@`; administrators must also belong to that domain.

`FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` and `FIREBASE_WEB_API_KEY` normally reuse the frontend project ID and API key. With the current standard HMAC verification, `CLOUDINARY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` reuses `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`, while `WEBHOOK_SECRET` must be independently random. `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` contains the entire JSON, not a path.

Hosted Supabase Edge Functions inject `SUPABASE_URL`, so no GitHub secret is needed. The workflow writes `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to Edge as `APP_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`. Production and development must use separate resources and credentials.

## Change checklist

- Regenerate and inspect committed output.
- Run Edge and architecture checks when contracts or schema are affected.
- Never commit secrets, production identifiers, or real user data.
- Update both language editions of affected documentation.
- Use a new migration for category removal or schema changes.
