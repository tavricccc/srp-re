# Architecture

[繁體中文](../architecture.md) · [Documentation home](../README.md)

This page explains component ownership, trust boundaries, and primary data flows. See [`structure.md`](../../structure.md) for the file-level module map.

The browser only receives public Firebase Web configuration and the Supabase publishable key. Writes, private reads, role decisions, upload signatures, and external side effects run on the backend.

## Technology and ownership

| Layer | Technology | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Web | Vue 3, TypeScript, Vite, Vue Router, Workbox | UI, routing, PWA, client workflows |
| Identity | Firebase Auth, App Check | Google sign-in, tokens, origin attestation |
| Push | Firebase Cloud Messaging | Personal and topic-based Web Push |
| API | Supabase Edge Functions, Deno | Authentication, authorization, rate limits, idempotency, dispatch |
| Data | Postgres, RLS, RPC, Realtime, Cron | Source of truth, transactions, policy, scheduling |
| Media | Cloudinary | Authenticated image storage and delivery |
| Copy | Notion API | Operational proposal and announcement copy |
| Limits | Upstash Redis REST | Cross-instance rate limiting |
| Delivery | GitHub Actions, Vercel, Supabase CLI | Verification, migrations, deployment |

## Frontend boundaries

`views/` assembles routes, `components/` renders application UI, `components/ui/` stays business-agnostic, `composables/` coordinates Vue workflows, `services/` owns remote boundaries, `lib/` contains Vue-independent utilities, and `types/` owns shared contracts. `AppShell` owns the desktop sidebar, mobile bottom navigation, route-wide content clearance, and shared create entry. Business components do not query tables or construct sensitive actions directly.

## Backend functions

| Function | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `backendAction` | Unified client gateway for auth, roles, limits, idempotency, and domain actions |
| `syncUser` | Synchronizes allowed-domain users and role claims after sign-in |
| `cloudinaryWebhook` | Verifies upload callbacks and updates image state |
| `outboxWorker` | Processes notifications, FCM, Notion, and other side effects |
| `processDeletionJobs` | Removes Cloudinary resources and synchronizes deletion state |
| `maintenanceCleanup` | Runs retention and maintenance RPCs |

Supabase's built-in JWT check is disabled for these functions because they validate Firebase tokens, webhook signatures, or dedicated secrets themselves. This does not mean the endpoints are anonymously authorized.

## Data and authorization

- `app_api` is client-visible but protected by RLS and controlled RPCs.
- `app_private` stores backend-only data and helpers.
- Public proposal records are separated from private author data.
- Transactions create outbox events alongside content changes.
- Realtime audiences are authorized for public, author, recipient, or admin access. Lists and comments reconnect and re-fetch after channel failures and periodically reconcile while visible. Selecting the active desktop sidebar item or mobile bottom navigation item refreshes proposal and announcement lists manually.
- Dashboard counters and aggregates avoid scanning primary content on each visit.

## Key flows

### Sign-in

The browser signs in with Firebase Google Auth, sends an ID token to `syncUser`, and the backend validates signature, project, verified email, and allowed domain. Every later action repeats backend authorization; client role state is never authoritative.

### Images

The browser compresses to WebP, obtains an authorized upload session, and uploads directly to an authenticated Cloudinary resource. A verified webhook marks the upload ready. Markdown stores only `srp-upload://<id>`, resolved in batches to expiring signed URLs. Deletion jobs remove failed, unused, or deleted resources.

### Notifications and synchronization

A content transaction creates an outbox event. A worker claims pending work and creates in-app notifications, FCM messages, or Notion updates. Retryable failures retain tracking data while detailed errors remain in provider logs.

## Deployment topology

`main` uses the GitHub `production` Environment and `dev` uses `development`. The backend workflow applies migrations, sets secrets, deploys functions, and runs a smoke test. The frontend workflow builds and deploys Vercel artifacts. A frontend deployment waits for the matching backend run when one commit changes both layers.

Architecture regressions are enforced by `tests/architecture.test.mjs`, including secret boundaries, authorization paths, stable pagination, upload validation, notification scope, and deployment ownership.
